The softmax function can be understood from Multinomial Logistic Regression employed for predicting probabilities of a Categorically distributed variable. Geometrically it maps $R^K$ to the boundary of a unit K-simplex(it is simply the convex hull of $k+1$ affinely independent points in $R^K$. Essentially it transforms a vector of size K to another vector of size K where the outputs sum to 1. It is worth noting that the mapping is actually from $R^K$ to $R^{K-1}$, so when a vector of size $K$ is transformed the $K_th$ vector is simply $1$- sumofk-1 vectors
